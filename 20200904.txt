A 0:00 - 0:04
Hello and welcome We English Speak, I’m FeFei.

B 0:05 - 0:08
I’m Rob.

C 0:07 - 0:13
Rob, what’s the smell? Are you cooking something?

D 0:14 - 0:18
Yes! It’s my favorite, roast beef. Yummy!

E 0:19 - 0:23
Roast beef? This isn’t really the time to be cooking.

F 0:24 - 0:30
Well, you said let’s do roast today, so I thought I’d make a start. Just got to do the roaster potatoes now.

G 0:31 - 0:37
Rob, stop! I meant let’s do the word, “roast”.

H 0:38 - 0:42
Oh, rihgt! Well, this is the good example of “roasting”.

I 0:43 - 1:00
No, Rob. It’s not the meaning I had in mind. “Roasting” is not just about cooking food in an oven. We can raost people by criticising them harshly. So Rob, you are very foolish to start cooking something while we are presenting a programme.

J 1:01 - 1:05
Oh, am I being roasted now?

K 1:06 - 1:10
You sure are. but you are not alone. Here are some examples.

L 1:13 - 1:19
We had to raost the teacher after she was seen shopping when she was supposed to be off work with flu.

M 1:20 - 1:26
Afte my powerpoint presentation froze during the important meeting, my boss gave me roasting.

N 1:27 - 1:35
She was roasted by her friends after she posted the picrures of herself on social media showing off her amazing suntan.

O 1:36 - 1:51
This is The English We Speak from BBC Learning English and we’re talking about the “roast” which means criticise severely. I’m sure you’re used to being roasted, Rob?

P 1:52 - 1:58
Well, if you mean I am hot and smell delicious, then I am roasted.

Q 1:59 - 2:00
Excuse me?

R 2:01 - 2:10
FeiFei, another meanings of “roast” is to tease someone in a light-herated way or give a funny come back when someone tries to humiliate you.

S 2:11 - 2:17
Oh, ha ha! But hold on, Rob. I can smell something else.

T 2:18 - 2:23
Oh no, I left the oven on and now the food is buring. Help!

U 2:24 - 2:30
Rob, you are really stupid, and you can’t cook either.

V 2:31 - 2:34
That’s me roasted! Bye. (Bye)
