A 0:06 - 0:11
Hello! This is 6 minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil(And I’m Georigina.)

B 0:12 - 0:19
Can I ask you something, Georgina? (Mm-mm-hmm).Gorgena? I said, I want to ask you something. Are you listneing to me?

C 0:20 - 0:24
Mm-mm-hmm. Just a second, Neil. I’m texting a friend.

D 0:25 - 0:39
Ah, has this you ever happened you? Someone too busy texting to talk. With huge rise of mobile phones in recent decades, commmunicating by text become more and more popular, and scenes like this have become increasingly common.

E 0:40 - 0:43
And send! There, all done. Now what were you saying, Neil?

F 0:44 - 0:56
In this programme, we’ll be investigating why people often choose the text, instead of talk to the people in their lives. We’ll be asking whether this popular form of communication is changing how we interact with each other.

G 0:57 - 1:02
And of course, we’ll be learning some related vocabulary as well. Now, Neil, what did you want to ask me?

H 1:03 - 1:25
My quiz question, Georgina, which is this? Young people are often the biggest users of mobile phones, but in a 2016 study, what percentage of British teenagers said they would prefer to send a text rather than speak to someone even if they were in the room? Is it a) 9%, b) 49%, or c) 99%?

I 1:26 - 1:33
That sounds pretty shocking! I can’t believe 99% of teenagers said that, so I’ll guess b) 49%.

J 1:34 - 1:45
OK, Georgina. We’ll find out later if that’s right.
In one way, the popularity of texting, sometimes called “talking with thumbs”, is understadable - people like to be able to be in control of what they say.

K 1:46 - 1:57
But this low-risk way of hiding behind a screen may come at a cost, as neuroscientist, Professor Shopie Scott, explained to Sandara Kanthal, for BBC World Service programme, The Why factor.

L 1:58 - 2:12
When we talk with our thumbs’ by text or email or instant message, we’re often prioritizing speed over clarity and depth. But when we can’t hear the way someone is speaking it’s all too easy to misunderstand their intention.

M 2:13 - 2:41
So if I say a phrase like, “Oh shut up!” - has a different meaning than, “Oh shut up!”. There’s an emotional thing there but also a strong kind of intonation: one’s sort of funny, one’s just agressive. Written down it’s just agressive - “Shut up” - and you can’t soften that.

We always speak with melody and intonation to our voice and we’ll change our meaning depending on that. You take that channel of information out of communication you lose another way that sense is being conveyed
