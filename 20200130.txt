### A 0:00 - 0:32

You may have heard that some people down in the prep school wrote some racial slurs on some message board. If you haven’t heard that, I wanted you to hear it from me.

If you’re outraged by those words, you’re in the right place.That kind of behavior has no place at the prep school, has no place at you SAFA and it has no place in the United States Air Force.You should be outraged not only as an airmen but as human being.

### B 0:33 - 1:00

And I’ll tell you that the appropriate resoponse for horrible language and horrible ideas, the appropriate response is a better idea.

So that’s why I’m here.That’s why all these people are up here on the staff tower. So let me have everybody who’s up.Please pull forward to the rails.

Also there are so many people here.They’re lining the outsides along the windows.These are members of the faculty, coaching staff,a OCS EMTs from the airfield, from my staff, my headquaters, all aspects of the 10th Air Base Wing, all aspects that make up you Safa and the United States Air Force Academy.

### C 1:19 - 1:53

Leader ship is here you.You heard from Brigadier General Goodwin, Brigadier General Armcost is here.Colonel block from the athletic department is here.Mr.Knowlton is in Washington DC right now.That’s why they’re here. That’s why we’re all here because we have a better idea.

Some of you may think that. That happened down in the prep school and doesn’t apply to us.I would be naive and we wolud all be naive to think that everything is perfect here.

### D 1:53 - 2:31

We would be naive to think that we shouldn’t discuss the topic.We would also be tone-deaf not to think about the backdrop of what’s going on in our country,things like Charlottesville in Ferguson, in the NFL.That’s why we have a better idea.

One of the ideas the Dean brought people together to discuss Charlottesville becuase what we should have is a civil discourse and talk about these issues.That’s a better idea.
