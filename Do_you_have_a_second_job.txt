Hello and welcome to 6 minute English. I’m Neil. This is the programme where in just 6 minutes we discuss interesting topic and teach some related English vocabulary. Joining me to do this is Rob. (Hello) Now Rob, we know your main job is to work here at BBC Learning English. But do you have a second job?

B 0:24 - 0:33
There’s no time for two jobs, Neil, but if there was, I think I’d take photographs and sell them. I do love photography, so I might as well make some money from it.

C 0:34 - 0:41
Good thinking, Rob! And having second job, particularly one that involoves using your skills and allowed you to follow your intersets, is so called a side hustle.

D 0:42 - 0:48
Yes, a side hustle. It’s something more and more of us involoved with these days. And that’s what we’ll be talking about shortly.

E 0:49 - 1:09
Well, my side hustle should be quiz master, because I’m always asking questions and today is no exception. According to the employees rating website Glassdoor, which job is thought be the best to have in the UK this year? Is it a) a software engineer, b) a teacher, or c) an audit mananegr?

F 1:10 - 1:13
Hmm, well, I suspect b) a teacher.

G 1:14 - 1:28
Well, you’ll just have to wait until the end of the programme to find out. But let’s talk more about side hustles - or secaond job. For some people, having two jobs is a necessity - a way to make ends meet. That means having just enough money to pay for the things you need.

H 1:30 - 1:36
That’s true but it now seems that more people want to put their skills and passions into practice to make extra money.

I 1:37 - 2:10
According to research by Henley Business School, around one in four workers run at least one side-hustle business, half of which were started in past two years. Those aged 25 to 34 are most likely to be involoved with 37% thought to run a sideline of some kind. A sideline also describes an extra job you do alongside your main job. BBC Radio 5 live spoke to someone whose side-hustle was so satisfing that it turned into her day job. Here is Elspeth Jachson, funder of Ragged life to explain why.
