### A 0:00 - 0:05
Hello and welcome to the News Review. I’m Rob. And joining me today is Cathreine. Hello Catherine.

### B 0:05 - 0:14

Hello Rob and hello everybody! Yes we’ve got a great strory today about a female politician who’s making history in the United Staes.

### C 0:15 - 0:30

Great and if you want to test yourself on the vocabulary we’re going to be talking about today, there’s a quiz on our website at bbclearningenglish.com but before you go there let’s have a listen to today’s news story with this BBC News report.

### D 0:31 - 0:44

The first black woman to be chosen as US Vice-President candidate, Kamala Harris, has accepted her nomination. She’ll run alongside Joe Biden to take on President Trump, who’s been accused by former US president Barack Obama of not taking the job serioously.

### E 0:45 - 1:00

Yes! So Kamara Hariss is making in the history in the United Sates. She is the first black Asian women to accept a nomination to run as vice president in the American elections.

### F 1:01 - 1:06

Yes. And we’ve got 3 words to talk about today to help you talk about this story. What are they, Catherine.

### G 1:07 - 1:12

They are “nod”, “mongering” and “blasts”.

### H 1:13 - 1:18

That’s “nod”, “mongering” and “blasts”. OK! Well, let’s start with your first headline please.

### I 1:19 - 1:31

Of coures, and we’re starting with the international Reuters’s website, the headline, “Kamala Harris accepts historic vice presidential nod”.

### J 1:32 - 1:38

Ok! So that’s “nod”, official act to suggest someone should be given a prize or a position.

### K 1:39 - 1:53

That’s right! It’s a 3 letter word, “nod”, “n”, “o”, “d”. It’s a noun and describes the movement. Roy, do you like biscuits? (I do.) You’re noding your head, aren’t you? Moving up…

### L 1:54 - 1:56

I’am, up and down, yes to meant “yes”.

### M 1:57 - 2:38

Yes! OK, Rob. Can I have your bisucuits please?(No) Shaking your head, this movement in a lot of cultures means “No”. So left to right is no, up and down means yes. And that’s the ideas of “nod”, when we use it in this sentence. It’s not a head movement but it is an agreement. It is saying yes in this case, saying yes to somebody, doing something of important or somebody getting a position of importance, maybe a recoginition, maybe a promotion. It’s when somebody gets, something good. That is given to them.

### N 2:39 - 2:44

OK. So It’s not just the physical nod, it’s not just someone going, Yes, you’re done well.
