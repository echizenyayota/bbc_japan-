A 0:00 - 0:11
Hong Kong means “Fragrant Habour”. And we can trace its stroy back something else that’s fragrant tea. Oh and drugs.

B 0:12 - 0:22
In the 1800s British were obsessed with tea much like today really. Britain bought a lot of tea from China. But China wasn’t buying much in return.

C 0:23 - 0:36
So to make money, the British smuggled opium into China. Million became addicted. And that led to the first opium war which China lost. The treaty of Nanjing ended the war in 1842.

D 0:37 - 0:54
It meant giving up a piece of land to the Biritsh. That’s was Hong Kong island, at the time just a small fishing village. After the second opium war Britain got part of the Kowloon Peninsula. And finally it got the new teritories this time on a 99 year lease.

E 0:57 - 1:05
The 20th century saw China embrace communism while Hong Kong capitalist economy boomed.

F 1:07 - 1:16
Fast forward to 1984. The 99 year deadline was coming up so Britain and China signed an agreement on Hogn Kong’s future.

G 1:17 - 1:29
"As a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China Hong Kong will maintain its economic system and way of life for 50 years after the 1st of July 1997."

H 1:30 - 1:34
And come 1997 Hong Kong was handed back to China.

I 1:35 - 1:38
"Now Hong Kong people are to run Hong Kong."

J 1:39 - 1:48
The promise of “One country, Two system” was designed to give Hong Kong high-level of autonomy until 2047.

K 1:49 - 2:05
Hong Kong has own legal and banking systems. People there use the Hong Kong dollar and has its mini consitution called “The Basic law”. It sets out things like keeping Hong Kong’s capitalist way of life and protecting the rights like freedom of speech.

L 2:06 - 2:16
Well, these rights and freedom that many people in Hong Kong are worried about they think they are being eroded long for the 50 year guarantee is up.
