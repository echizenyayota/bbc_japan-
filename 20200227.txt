### A 0:00 - 0:25

I was surprised to see the mixture of the dirty zone which we call it the "Red zone" and the "Green Zone" which is clean zone,(ah) free of virus,becuase this is the first thing we do in infection control majors (ah) everywhere in the world.

You deal with Ebola. And you deal with SARS and you have to distinguish between where the virus doesn't exist and where the potential could exist.

### B 0:26 - 0:44

And I was so scared that anybody could have the virus everywhere and could be (ah) contaminated by virus.

(Ah)so I got to shocked,and I was scared of having infection inside the cruise ship.And I still, I'm scared of developing a disease in a next couple of days.

### C 0:45 - 0:48

How would you go about setting up the "Green zone" and "Red zone" in the cruise ship?

### D 0:49 - 1:06

The easiest way is to put everyone in the cruise at "Red zone". So you can remove every headquaters which is inside the cruise ship right now, to outside the cruise ship.There's virus free enviroment. So you could do any kind of work there.
