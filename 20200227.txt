### A 0:00 - 0:25

I was surprised to see the mixture of the dirty zone which we call it the "Red zone" and the "Green Zone" which is clean zone,(ah) free of virus,becuase this is the first thing we do in infection control majors (ah) everywhere in the world.

You deal with Ebola. And you deal with SARS and you have to distinguish between where the virus doesn't exist and where the potential could exist.

### B 0:26 - 0:44

And I was so scared that anybody could have the virus everywhere and could be (ah) contaminated by virus.

(Ah)so I got to shocked,and I was scared of having infection inside the cruise ship.And I still, I'm scared of developing a disease in a next couple of days.

### C 0:45 - 0:48

How would you go about setting up the "Green zone" and "Red zone" in the cruise ship?

### D 0:49 - 1:06

The easiest way is to put everyone in the cruise at "Red zone". So you can remove every headquaters which is inside the cruise ship right now, to outside the cruise ship.There's virus free enviroment. So you could do any kind of work there.

### E 1:07 - 1:18

But they didn’t do it and just kept being inside cruise ship.And having a half way protected and a half way unprotected and that’s most dangerous way of dealing with the infection disease epidemic.

### F 1:19 - 1:28

I will know we were really shocked to see you say when you were in past the video you were more scared of the ship than even were covering on Ebola outbreak in Africa.

### G 1:29 - 1:50

I felt much safer (than) when I was in Africa.Becuase you know where the virus disease exists and you know where the patient is and you know there’s clear distinction between “Red zone” and “Green zone” so you had to take (an) extra cuation for fighting against Ebola but still you know you watch what we were fighting against and where we were fighting.

### H 1:51 - 2:00

But inside “Diamond-Princess” you have no idea where there’s the virus so you have no way to say where you have to fight and where you don’t have to fight.

### I 2:01 - 2:11

When we were seeing people evacuating from the ship and walking out of the gate and getting on the buses going home for mixing the general population.How concerned are you by that?
