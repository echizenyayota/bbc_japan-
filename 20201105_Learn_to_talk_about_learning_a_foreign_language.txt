A 0:00 - 0:16
Hello and welocme to 6 minute English. The show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.
I’m Rob.

B 0:17 - 0:20
“Watashi no namae ha Neil desu”. And that means my name is Neil.

C 0:21 - 0:26
Ahh, Neil,here’s a question for you. Can you speak any languages other than English of course? I think you can.

D 0:27 - 0:37
"Un poco de espanol"Ahh, that means a little bit of Spanish. Ahh some Japanese which I tried at the beggining and also a little bit of Czech language “Dobry den.Jak se mas”.

E 0:39 - 0:42
Very impressive! So what tips can you give for learning to speak another language?

F 0:43 - 0:48
Well, practice, practice, practice, pracitce. And don’t be afraid of making mistakes as I no doubt have.

G 0:49 - 0:55
Well, my aim this year is to master the Spanish language. “Master” means to learn thoroughly.

H 0:56 - 1:17
Muy bien! Well, you’re not alone! A survey by British Council found learning language is a new year’s resolution for about one in five Britons in 2018. So learning Spanish is a good start,Rob. But do you know approximately how many lauguages there are in the world all together?
Are there

a) 70,
b) 700 or,
and c) 7,000.

I 1:18 - 1:25
Well,I know there are many but surely not 7,000 so I’m going to say b)700. But don’t expect me to learn all of them.

J 1:26 - 1:34
I won’t Rob.But I will give you the answer later. So we all know learning another language is good thing. It brings us many benefit.

K 1:35 - 1:42
Yes, we can communicate with people from other countries and when we’re travelling we can undestand what signs and notices say. So we don’t get lost.

L 1:43 - 1:56
That’s right! But many scientist also believe that knowledge of the language can boost the brain power. A study of monolingul and bilingul speakers suggests speaking two languages can help slow down the brain’s decline with age.

M 1:57 - 2:08
Oh, good reasons. But, Neil, learning another language is hard. It would take me years and years to become fluent in say, Madarin - by fluent I mean speak very well without difficulty.

N 2:09 - 2:21
Well, this depends on your mother tongue. In general, the closer the second language is to the learner’s native tongue and culture in terms of the vocabulary - sounds and sentence structure - , the easier it would be to learn.

O 2:22 - 2:25
But whatever the language, there is so much vocaburaly to learn - you know, thousands and thousands of words.

P 2:26 - 2:39
Maybe not,Rob. Professor Sturt Webb, a linguist from the University of the Western Ontario, may be able to help you. He spoke to BBC Radio 4’s More or less programme and explained that you don’t need to do that.

Q 2:40 - 3:14
For language learners in a foregin language setting - so for example, if you were learning French in Britain or English in Japan, Students may often really struggle to learn more than 2,000, 3000 words after many years of study.

So for example, there was study in Taiwan recently that showed that after 9 years study about half of the student had still failed to learn the most frequent 1,000 words. Now they knew lower frequecy words but they hadn’t mastered those most important words.

R 3:15 - 3:26
So, Rob, don’t waste your time to try to learn everything single word. Professor Webb spoke there about research that showed students knew lower frequency words but weren’t learning enough high for frequency word.

S 3:27 - 3:35
Right, and frequecy here means the number of times something happens - so the important words to learn high frequency ones. How many are there exactly?

T 3:36 - 3:37
Here’s Professor Stuart Webb again.

U 3:38 - 4:00
For example, with English, I would suggest if you learn the 800 most frequent lemmas - which is a word and its inflections that will account for about 75% of all of the English lauguage.

So that learing those 800 words first will provide the foundation for which you may be able to learn the lower frequency words.

V 4:01 - 4:07
Fascinating suff. And good to know I just need to learn about 800 words or what he calls lemmas.

W 4:08 - 4:24
Yes. A lemma is the simplest form or base form of a word. And the inflection here refers to how the base word is changed according to its use in a sentence. Knowing these things here gives you foundation. That is the basics from which your lanuguage learning will develop. Simple.

X 4:25 - 4:27
Thanks! Goodness! I am learning just one new language!

Y 4:28 - 4:40
But how many lanugages could you potentially be learning Rob? Early I asked you, approximately how many languages there are in the world altogether.
Are there a)70 ,b)700 c)7000?

Z 4:41 - 4:42
And I said 700. Was I right?

AA 4:43 - 4:53
No Rob! You were wrong! There are around 7,000 recognized lanugauges in the world. UNESCO has identified 2,500 languages which it claims are at risk of extinction.

AB 4:54 - 5:02
A sobering thought Neil. Now shall we remind ourselves of some of the English vocabulary we’ve heard today. Starting with master.

AC 5:03 - 5:11
To master a new skill, in this context, means to learn thoroughly or learn well “Rob hopes to master Spanish before he starts a new job in Madrid.”

AD 5:12 - 5:21
Really? That’s news to me, Neil! But it would be good to be fluent in Spanish or any language or to speak it fluently - that speaking it very well and without difficulty.

AE 5:22 - 5:35
Now our next word was frequency. Here we are refering to high and low frequency words - so it means how often they occur. Examples of high frequency word are “it”, “the” and “and”.

AF 5:36 - 5:46
And our next word is inflections. These are the changes to the basic form of the words according to their function in a sentence. Such as adding an “s” to the end of word to make it plural.

AG 5:47 - 5:52
And don’t forget lemma which is the simplest form or base form of a word before an inflection is added.

AH 5:53 - 5:56
And finally foundation which means the basics your learning grows from.

AI 5:57 - 6:05
That just leaves me to remind you that you can learn with us at bbclearningenglish.com. That’s it for today’s 6 minute English we hope you enjoed it. Bye for now.
