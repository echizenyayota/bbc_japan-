A 0:08 - 0:11
Hello! This is 6 minute English. I’m Sam. (And I’m Rob.)

B 0:12 - 0:16
Before you got your first job, Rob, did you do any work experience?

C 0:17 - 0:25
I think I may have done a day or two at some companies, just shadowing, watching how they did things - but nothing much more than that.

D 0:26 - 0:41
Some companies offer students or recent graduates what they call “internships”. These are extended periods of work experience where someone can be working full-time without an actual contract and in many cases without even being paid.

E 0:42 - 0:49
Yes. This is a bit of a problem, isn’t it? Some companies are being accused of using students and graduated as a cheap or free labour.

F 0:51 - 1:18
Yes, although the counter argument is that internships are valuable experience for people who need it before they can get a real job.

Well, we’ll look at this topic a little more after this week quiz question. On the topic of businesses companies, which is the oldest stock exchange in the world? Is it a) Bombay, b) New York, or c) Amsterudam? What do you think, Rob?

G 1:19 - 1:25
Tricky, because I was expecting London on that list. I’m going to take a guess then at a Amstrerdam.

H 1:26 - 1:44
OK, I will reveal the answer later in the programme. James Turner is the chief executive of an education charity. Recently he took part in a discussion on BBC Radio progorrame You and Yours, on the topic of internships. What does he think is a big issue with unpaid internships?

I 1:45 - 2:03
In many careers, we’re now seeing that it’s almost expectation that a young person does an internship before they stand a chance of getting that first full-time job in a profession. And the issue with that from a sort of social mobility point of view is that a substantial proportation of those internships are unpaid and that effectively rules out those who can’t afford to work for free.

J 2:04 - 2:07
So what is the problem without unpaid internships, Rob?

K 2:08 - 2:23
Well, if you can’t afford to for free, it makes it very difficult to do an internship - particulary in expensive cities like London. This excludes or rules out of a lot of people from the benefits of an internship.

L 2:24 - 2:38
This is bad for social mobility, which is the ability of people to move to higher, better paid levels in society. So the poorer you are, the more difficult it can be to get good job, even if you have the ability.

M 2:39 - 2:40
Could you afford to work for free here in London, Sam?

N 2:41 - 2:55
No. I can barely afford to live in London as it is, so the idea of doing an upaid internship would not appeal to me at all. Turner goes on to talk about other issues that are also problematic in internship programmes.

O 2:56 - 3:08
Too often internships are open to those with established connection in the professions and again that rules out those young people who don’t have the well-connected families or friends who can open those doors for them.

P 3:09 - 3:10
So what are these other issues?

Q 3:11 - 3:26
In many cases he says that internship opportunities are only available to those with established to the company or industry. This means they have some pre-exiting link with the company, for example, “through family of friends’ families”.

R 3:27 - 3:36
Yes, it’s a lot easier if your family is well-conected, if it has a lot of contacts and links to particular company or important people in the company.

S 3:37 - 3:44
These links make it easier to open doors to the opportunity. To open door is an expression that means “to get access to”.

T 3:45 - 3:58
So, it seems that to be able to do an unpaid internships you need to have a fair bit of money and to get an internship in first place you may need to have a previous link to the company through a family connection, for example.

U 3:59 - 4:10
So the system would seem to be difficult for poorer families and make it more difficlut for students without the resources or connections to get on the job ladder. Here’s James Turner again.

V 4:11 - 4:23
Too often internships are open to those with established connections in the professions and again that rules out those young people who don’t have the well-connected families or friends who can open those doors for them.

W 4:24 - 4:36
Right, time now to answer this week’s question. Which is the oldest stock exchange in the world? Is it a) Bombay, b) New York, or c) Amsterdam? Rob, what did you say?

X 4:37 - 4:38
I went for Amsterdam.

Y 4:39 - 4:46
Well done, that’s correct! Congratulations to everyone who got right and extra bonus point if you know that date. Rob?

Z 4:47 - 4:49
Haven’t a clue. 1750?

AA 4:50 - 4:52
Actually, It’s a lot earlier, 1602.

AB 4:53 - 4:55
Wow, that’s much earlier than I thought.

AC 4:56 - 5:07
Right! Let’s have a look again at today’s vocabulary. We’ve been talking about “internships” which are periods of work at companies as a way for students or new graduates to get experience in a particular field.

AD 5:08 - 5:19
If they are upaid, it can make social mobiltiy very difficult. This is the movement from lower social level to high one and it’s difficult for poorer candidates can’t afford to work for free.

AE 5:20 - 5:24
Yes, the cost rules them out. It excludes them from the opportunity.

AF 5:25 - 5:33
What helps is if you have established connections’ with a company. This refers to previous or pre-existing links with a company.

AG 5:34 - 5:47
And also if your family is “well-connected”, if you have good connections, for example if your father plays golf with CEO, it can make “open-doors”, or in other words, it can make it easier to get into the company.

AH 5:48 - 5:49
So Sam, are you well-connected?

AI 5:50 - 5:51
No, only to my smartphone.

AJ 5:52 - 6:05
Same here - but will still made it to BBC Learning English and you can find more from us online, on social media and our app. But for now that’s all 6 minute English. See you again soon. Bye, bye.(Bye everyone.)
