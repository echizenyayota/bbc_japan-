### A 0:00 - 0:03

Hello! This is The English We Speak with me, FeiFei.

### B 0:04 - 0:05

It’s me, Rob.

### C 0:06 - 0:09

Hey, Rob! You look a bit fed up.

### D 0:10 - 0:17

I am. I had a ticket to see Roy’s Rolling Biscuits next week. But now the gig has been cancelled.

### E 0:18 - 0:24

Cancelled? Meaning a planned activity will not happen? Well a lot of things have been cancelled at the moment.

### F 0:25 - 0:29

But this was the Biscuits, you know, the best band ever.

### G 0:30 - 0:34

Well Rob, to be honest, I cancelled them long time ago.

### H 0:35 - 0:38

What? You had tickets? And you cancelled them.

### I 0:39 - 0:48

No, Rob. This is not the meaning of “cancelled”. I didn’t like the bad language in the band’s song. So I stopped supporting them. I cancelled them.

### J 0:50 - 1:04

Yep. When I cancelled someone, you don’t agree with what they do or say and you stop supporting or promoting them. This particulary relates to celebrities. So if you don’t like someone, cancel them.

### K 1:05 - 1:07

Ok FeiFei, let’s hear the examples.
