### A 0:00 - 0:05

Hello and Welcome to the English We Speak with me FeiFei, and me, Roy.

### B 0:06 - 0:12

Roy, please will you sit down? It’s really annoying with you always just standing there.

### C 0:13 - 0:30

No. I refuse to sit down. I haven’t sat down for the whole week. I heard you talking about the sticking point the other day, and after you played a joke on me and glued me to the chair. I will not sit down ever again.

### D 0:31 - 0:47

No, Roy. A sticking point refers to a problem or issue that prevents towards a goal or an agreement. I was talking about a negoticating my new work contract. I think I sould be given “unicorn truffles” everyday as part of the job.

### E 0:48 - 0:54

Wait, so sticking point in your new contract is that you want “Unicorn Truffles”.
