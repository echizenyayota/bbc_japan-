### A 0:00 - 0:05

Hello and Welcome to the English We Speak with me FeiFei, and me, Roy.

### B 0:06 - 0:12

Roy, please will you sit down? It’s really annoying with you always just standing there.

### C 0:13 - 0:30

No. I refuse to sit down. I haven’t sat down for the whole week. I heard you talking about the sticking point the other day, and after you played a joke on me and glued me to the chair. I will not sit down ever again.

### D 0:31 - 0:47

No, Roy. A sticking point refers to a problem or issue that prevents towards a goal or an agreement. I was talking about a negoticating my new work contract. I think I sould be given “unicorn truffles” everyday as part of the job.

### E 0:48 - 0:54

Wait, so sticking point in your new contract is that you want “Unicorn Truffles”.

### F 0:55 - 1:01

Yes. I also asked for an eagle called Clive but I want “Unicorn Truffles”.

### G 1:02 - 1:06

That’s a great idea. I might ask for “Unicorn Truffles” too.

### H 1:07 - 1:14

Sorry, Roy! That’s only for amazing people like me. Now sit down and let’s listen to these examples. 

### I 1:21 - 1:29

Bob and Ahmed could not agree on the budget. The amount spent on stationery was a real sticking point.

### J 1:30 - 1:37

The amount of time it would take to build the railway was sticking point when it came to sigining the final agreement.

### K 1:42 - 1:52

This is The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. And we are talking about the expression, “sticking point” which refers to an issue or a problem that blocks a negotiation or an agreement.

### L 1:53 - 2:04

I’m glad I could sit down. I was getting really tired. So have you finally stopped playing jokes aroud the office. Am I safe again?

### M 2:05 - 2:08

Yes. I’ve stopped. You are safe.

### N 2:09 - 2:12

That’s good! Your jokes were real sticking point in our friendship.

### O 2:13 - 2:21

Well, talking of sticking points, I’m off to negotiate in new contract and get some of those “Unicorn Truffles”. Oh, and my eagle!

### P 2:22 - 2:24

I love “Unicorn Truffles”.

### Q 2:25 - 2:36

Well, there are some on that tables overthere. You could have all of them. But sadly you stuck to a chair again. I got you again with my prank. Bye Roy.

### R 2:37 - 2:42

No. Don’t leave me stuck to a chair again again! FeiFei? Ohh, Bye.
