### A 0:07 - 0:11

Hello! This is 6 minute English from BBC Learning English, I’m Neil. And I’m Georgina.

### B 0:12 - 0:22

COVID-19 has changed the everyday life for people in the countiries around the world. The coronavirus wasn’t first pandemic to cause mass sickness and disrupt daily life.

### C 0:23 - 0:37

Between 2002 and 2004 an outbreak of the disease known as SARS or severe acute respirtory syndrome caused hundreds of death in Southern China before spreading to other parts of the world.

### D 0:38 - 0:50

The virus that caused SARS survived by mutating, changing as it reproducing itself bodies infected people and this caused to create strains, slight variations of the original.

### E 0:51 - 0:59

COVID-19, the disease caused by the strain of the original SARS virus we are experiencing, now has been called SARS-2.

### F 1:00 - 1:34

In this programme, we’ll be looking at the origin of COIVID-19 and hearing new evidence about the scale of the threat we face from the disease. And of course, we’ll be learning the new vocabulary as well. The first, it’s time for hour quiz question. We know that white blood cells make up part of the immune system our body needs to fight infecious diseases like COVID-19 but how many white blood cells per micro litre does the average adults human need? Is it a)7,000, b) 17,000, or c) 70,000?

### G 1:35 - 1:40

Hmmm, in that case, I’d say more is better, so c) 70,000.

### H 1:41 - 1:50

OK, we’ll find out the answer at the end of programme. Now Georgina, you mentioned that the disease spreading across the world today wasn’t first COOVID-19 type disease.

### I 1:51 - 2:05

That’s right. In fact, a recent research project in China has indetified over 700 different types of coronavirus carried by bats. Some these virus strains are thought to have already crossed over to humans.

### J 2:06 - 2:19

Dr.Peter Daszak of NY’s Eco-Health Alliance thinks that new strains of the virus have the potential to cause future pandemics. He spent years in the Chinese countryside looking for the coronavirus that could jump from bats to humans.

### K 2:20 - 2:25

Here is talking to the BBC World Service programme, Science in Action.

### L 2:27 - 2:54

It would have been great to have found the precursor to SARS-2, but what would have been even better was to have found it before SARS-2 emerged and raise the red flag on it and stop the outbreak. But we didn’t do that. What we were looking for were at the time our hypothesis was that SARS1, the original SARS virus which we all thought had disappeared, was still out there in bats, and that was what we were looking for. So we found a lots of SARS-1 related virus.
