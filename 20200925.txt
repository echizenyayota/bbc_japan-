A 0:00 - 0:06
Hello and Welcome to The English We Speak, with me, FeiFei, and me, Roy.

B 0:06 - 0:09
FeiFei, did you get me a drink of water?

C 0:10 - 0:14
No, I did not. Go and get yourself one.

D 0:15 - 0:19
But I thought you were bringing me one because I overheard you’re saying to Neil I was really thirsty.

E 0:21 - 0:32
All right, sorry! You weren’t meant to hear that. I mean you’re thirsty on social media. You’re always posting photos of yourself trying to get compliments and attention.
