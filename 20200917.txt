A 0:08 - 0:12
Hello. This is 6 minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.

B 0:13 - 0:14
And I’m Sam. How are you, Neil?

C 0:14 - 0:16
Oh I’ve been busy and as a bee this week, Sam.

D 0:17 - 0:19
Ah, don’t you sound like bee’s knees.

E 0:20 - 0:22
All right, Sam. There’s no need to get a bee in your bonnet.

F 0:23 - 0:28
As you can hear, English is full of idioms involoving bees.

G 0:29 - 0:35
But the sad truth is that bee numbers are declining at an alerming rate and in some places disappearing altogether.

H 0:36 - 0:39
And this has serious consequences for humans.

I 0:40 - 0:46
Today, one third of foods we eat depends on insects to pollinate crops, fruits and vegetables.

J 0:47 - 0:56
But bees are in trouble. In some European countiries up to half of all bee species are facing extinction, placing our food supply chain at risk.

K 0:57 - 1:20
Bees are vital in enpollinating hundreds of crops, apples, blackbereies, cucumbers. In fact, almost all plants need insects reproduce, which is my quiz question. All of the world’s top 50 crops, how many rely on insect poolination? Is it a) 35 out of 50, b) 40 out of 50 and c) 45 out of 50?

L 1:21 - 1:27
I reckon those busy bees pollinate, b)40 out of 50 common crops.

M 1:28 - 1:39
Ok, Sam. We’ll find out the answer later. Now if you think back to your school biology lessons, you may remember the plants and flowers contain both male and female reproductive parts inside.

N 1:40 - 1:51
But what exactly is going on when bees pollinate a plant. Here’s Claire Bate from BBC World Service Programme, People Fixing the world to remind us.

O 1:52 - 2:22
What is the pollination? All flowering plants need it to reproduce. Pollen is moved from the male part of a flower to the female part of a flower, then fertilization can happen causing fruit to grow. Some staple crops, such wheat, rice and corn are pollinated by the wind. However, many plants don’t release their pollen easily and this is where insects, and especially bees, come in. As they collect nectar to eat, pollen sticks to them and carry it from flower to flower.
