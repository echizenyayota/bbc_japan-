A 0:06 - 0:12
Hello. This is 6 minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.(And I’m Georigina.)

B 0:13 - 0:21
I’ve really had enough of this coronavirus, Georgina! People getting sick, losing their jobs and to top it off, the pubs in some places are closed!

C 0:22 - 0:37
I know it’s bad, Neil. But compared to historical pandemics like the Spanish flu and economic crises like the Great Depression. Coronavirus isn’t accually so bad. You’ve got to look at the big picture - the long term, overall view of a complex situation.

D 0:38 - 0:42
Hmmm, somehow that’s not very comforting, Georgina. But tell me more.

E 0:43 - 1:03
Well, we’ve heard lots from politicians and scientists about the spread of coronavirus, but a historian’s view might give us fresh a look at bigger picture - and maybe a more helpful point of view. So in this programme, we’ll be hearing from historian, Peter Frankopan, author of bestselling book, The Silk Roads.

F 1:04 - 1:09
Ah, the title of that book, The Silk Road, reminds me of my quiz question, Georgina. Are you ready to have a go?

G 1:10 - 1:16
I’ll try, Neil. But the only thing I know about the Silk Roads is that they were ancient routes along which people travelled the earth.

1. “along which”
Can you replace this “along which” with “where”?

H 1:17 - 1:38
Very good, Georgina! Not just people but also ideas, religions, languages and diseases travelled from place to place along these ancient roads. But where exactly did the Silk Roads run? That’s my quiz question. Was it a) from South America to Europe, b) from Africa to Asia, or c) Asia to Europe?

I 1:39 - 1:43
Well, since the current pandemic came from Wuhan, I’ll say c) from Asia to Europe.

J 1:44 - 1:58
OK, Georigina! We’ll find out later if that’s right. What’s certain is that disease passing from place to place and from animals to human is nothing new. Listen to historian, Peter Frankopan, being interviewed for the BBC programmes, HARD TALK.

K 1:59 - 2:02
See if you can hear the reason he gives for how diseases are spread.
