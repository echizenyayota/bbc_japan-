Roy, why are you hitting that table with a hammer?

Well, I got your message about flattening the curve and then I saw that this table had a bit of bump in it. So I wanted to make sure you were happy.

### D 0:25 - 0:36

No, Roy! When I talked about flatten the curve, it relates to lowering and smoothing out the peak on a graph or chart.

### E 0:37 - 0:50

Oh, because you were talking about the rate of the infection in the UK. It’s really important to flatten the curve of the infection to avoid our healthcare services being overwhelmed with too many patients one time.

That’s right. Now let’s listen to these examples.

This is the English We Speak from the BBC Learning English. And we are talking about the expression, “flatten the curve”, which has been used a lot during coronavirus crisis. It means to reduce the peak of a graph or chart.

### K 1:32 - 1:44

Yes. People have been in lockdown and social distancing to flatten the curve. It seems the rate of infection in the UK and has decreased of late.

Yes! It seems that way. But I can’t believe you were hitting that table.

Roy, now my chair is broken. What happened to the wheels?
