### A 0:00 - 0:17

Japan's about to get a new emperor,Naruhito.He is the eldest son of the outgoing emperor.But This person,Naruhito's only child, isn't next in line. It's his younger brother,then his nephew.

### B 0:18 - 0:27

That's because Japan has actually a law where women can't be on the throne.And that's problem for them.Because the imperial family is running out of male heirs.

### C 0:29 - 0:44

Recent polls have shown,many Japanese are fine with the female emperor.And there have been women on the throne in the past.

In fact there had been eight female emperors.The last one ruled about two hundred and fifty years ago.

### D 0:45 - 1:07

So why does Japan change this rule?All the same family has been on the throne for two and a half thousand years.The emperor was even worshipped as a God and soldiers would die him.

The monarchy has also been centeral to Japanese identity.Traditionalists believe that only a man can preserve this lineage.

### E 1:08 - 1:19

In 1889 Japan's goverment presented at the constitution that only a man can be on the throne.This was the start of big problem for the imperial family.

### F 1:20 - 1:40

Why?Because after WW2 Japan introduced another law saying the emperor could only come from this specific branch of the family.

And the family just kept having girls. By the mids-2000s(mid-two thousands) there were no male's in the younger generation.

### G 1:41 - 2:00

So Japanese goverment sat down on prepare to change the law.But then this happened.Prince Hisahito was born.

Now he is the younger person in line to be on the throne .Unless he gets married and has a son, Japan won't run out of their emperors.

### H 2:01 - 2:10

The current goverment is critical conservative so it's not likely to change the laws.But it's not enough a few decades Japan might have no choice.
