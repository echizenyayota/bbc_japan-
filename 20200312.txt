That's because Japan has actually a law where women can't be on the throne.And that's problem for them.Because the imperial family is running out of male heirs.

### C 0:29 - 0:44

Recent polls have shown,many Japanese are fine with the female emperor.And there have been women on the throne in the past.

In fact there had been eight female emperors.The last one ruled about two hundred and fifty years ago.

### D 0:45 - 1:07

So why does Japan change this rule?All the same family has been on the throne for two and a half thousand years.The emperor was even worshipped as a God and soldiers would die him.

The monarchy has also been centeral to Japanese identity.Traditionalists believe that only a man can preserve this lineage.
