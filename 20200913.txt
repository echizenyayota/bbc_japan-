Oh! Yes, it is. And what a great suggestion that I buy you an ice cream!

D 0:25 - 0:27
Thanks, Rob!

E 0:28 - 0:34
So come on then, what flavor do you want, chocolate, strawbery, salted caramel?

F 0:35 - 0:39
Vannilla for me, please. It’s my favorite flavor of ice cream.

G 0:40 - 0:48
Vanilla? Oh, FeiFei, that’s a bit boring, a bit ordinary.

H 0:49 - 1:03
It’s just ice cream, Rob but the word “vanilla” can be used to describe something basic or brand. So vanilla ice cream is very poupular because it is very delicious but your taste in clothes is just…

Vanilla? Thanks! I think we should hear some examples.

This is the English We Speak from BBC Learning English. And we’re talking about the word, “vanilla” which can be used to describe something basic, ordinary or boring. So come on then Rob. If my vanilla ice cream is so vanilla, what flavor are you going for?

N 1:34 - 1:56
It’s got to be salted caramel.

O 1:57 - 2:04
That’s so vanilla! Everyone is eating salted caramel flavor things these days.

P 2:05 - 2:11
Well, luckily for you! I’ve forgotten to bring any money. So no ice cream for either of us.

Q 2:12 - 2:14
Oh well, back to work then!

R 2:15 - 2:20
That’s vanilla too. It’s such a lovely day. Shall we stay in the park a little longer?
