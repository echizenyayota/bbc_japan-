A 0:00 - 0:17

Good evening. The struggle against Covid-19 is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year, this disease killed almost a million people and caused havoc to economies everywhere.

B 0:18 - 0:44
Here in the UK, we mourn every person we have lost and we grieve with their families. And yet I’m more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win, and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face. None of them easy, and why we must take action now.

C 0:45 - 1:12
I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before when the sickness took hold in this country in Marach. We pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter we stayed at home protected the NHS and saved thousands of lives. And for months with those disciplines of social distancing, we’ve kept that virus at bay.

D 1:13 - 1:27
But we have to acknowledge that this is a great and freedom loving country and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches, too many oppotunities for our invisible enermy to slipe through undetected.

E 1:28 - 2:04
The virus has started to spread again in an exponetional way. Infections are up. Hospital admissions are climbing.We can see what’s happening in France and Spain. And we know, alas, this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring. And the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible. And the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families, losing loved ones before their time.

F 2:05 - 2:30
And I know that faced with that risk the Birtish people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them you and that’s what we are doing night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves, the joint resolve of this coutry to work together to surppress covid now.

G 2:31 - 3:08
So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England early closing for pubs, bars, table service, only closing businesses that are not coping secure expanding the use of face coverings, new fines for those that fail to comply, once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rules of six indoors and outdoors. A tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown.

H 3:09 - 3:30
I know that this approch robust but that proportionate already carries the support of all main parties in parlirment after discussion with colleagues in the devolved administrations.
