Good evening. The struggle against Covid-19 is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year, this disease killed almost a million people and caused havoc to economies everywhere.

Here in the UK, we mourn every person we have lost and we grieve with their families. And yet I’m more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win, and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face. None of them easy, and why we must take action now.

And the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families, losing loved ones before their time.
