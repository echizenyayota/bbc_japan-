### A 0:06 - 0:10

Hello! This is 6 minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.

### B 0:11 - 0:18

And I’m Sam, still working from home, as you can hear, but for many, the return to the office has begun.

### C 0:19 - 0:28

And to make things safe, new thermal cameras are being installed in some work places. They measure body temparature to screen for Coronavirus.

### D 0:29 - 0:35

After weeks of working at home, the return to the office is slowly getting underway in number of countries.

### E 0:36 - 1:05

But workplaces are having to change in this Cornavirus era. Lots of companies are rushing to install technology to make offices and workplaces safer. Sensors that monitor our movements, smartphone apps that alert us if you get too close to workmates and even devices that take a temparature could all become the new normal. That’s a phrase we hear a lot these days, meaning a previously unfamiliar situation that has become usual and expected.

### F 1:06 - 1:13

In this programme, we’ll take a look at how this technology works and ask if it really is the answer looking for.

### G 1:14 - 1:33

But first, today’s quiz question, the thermal cameras are mentioned screen for Coronavirus by recording skin temperature in the area of the body which most closely resembles the intenal body temperature but which area is that? , is it a) the eye, b) the ear or c) the norse?

### H 1:34 - 1:35

I’ll say a) the eye.

### I 1:36 - 1:55

Okay Sam, We’ll find out later if you were right. Now, as employees slowly return to work tech-companies are busy finding ways for them to do so safely. One such company, “Microshare” is managed by Charles Paumelle. He spoke to BBC World Servicep programme “Tech Tent” to explain a possible solution.

### J 1:56 - 2:21

The technology that we are offering is using Bluetooth wristbands or tags that people are wearing within the workplace which detect proximity events. When the proximity events has been recorded it’s been saved by the company in case they need to, further down the line, retrace the steps of a certain preson who has been declared as infected and inform anyone else may have been in contact with.

### K 2:22 - 2:44

One important way to control Coronavirus involves contact tracing. This means someone who tests positive for the disease informs everyone else they’ve been in contact with. Microshare’s system for this uses Bluetooth technology that allows computers, mobile phohe and other devices to communicate with each other without being conected by wires.

### L 2:45 - 2:55

Employees wear Bluetooth response which register when workers come into close proximity how near a person is to another person.

### M 2:56 - 3:04

Anyone who has been close to a workmate will then known they have to take action if that person is found to have later down the line in the future.
