### A 0:00 - 0:15

I stand before you again tonight.After two terms as your president, to tell you I am more optimistic about the future of America than even before.

- Why does “to” exists in the second sentence?
- I would like you to say “than even before.” in other way.Esepecially, I don’t understand why “even” exists.

### B 0:18 - 0:45

America I know is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity.

Amreica I know is decent and generous.Black,white,Latino,Asian,Native Amrerican, young,old,gays,straight,men,women,folks with disablities,all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big bold country that we love.

That’s what I see.That’s the America I know.

- How far do “decent” and “generous” quarify"? Is it “folks with disablities” or “all”?
- “straight” meaning Heterosexual?
- Why does he use the word of “folks” instead of “people”?
- The second sentence is very long and difficult .I would like you to say it in other way shortly.
