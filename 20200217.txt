### A 0:00 - 0:15

I stand before you again tonight.After two terms as your president, to tell you I am more optimistic about the future of America than even before.

#### Why does “to” exists in the second sentence?

- to tell (the truth) → （あなたに）実を言うと
- to tell you (the truth) → （あなたに）実を言うと


#### I would like you to say “than even before.” in other way.Esepecially, I don’t understand why “even” exists.

- even （強調している、~でさえも）

### B 0:18 - 0:45

America I know is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity.

Amreica I know is decent and generous.Black,white,Latino,Asian,Native Amrerican, young,old,gays,straight,men,women,folks with disablities,all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big bold country that we love.

That’s what I see.That’s the America I know.

#### How far do “decent” and “generous” quarify"? Is it “folks with disablities” or “all”?

- Amreica I know is decent and generous.

#### “straight” meaning Heterosexual?

- Yes.It is not the slung.

#### Why does he use the word of “folks” instead of “people”?

- folks → 特定の集団
- these houses are for old folks

#### The second sentence is very long and difficult.I would like you to say it in other way shortly.

- All races and all people who have different sexuality pledge allegiance under the same proud flag to this big bold country that we love.
