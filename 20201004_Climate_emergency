A 0:00 - 0:07
Hello and welcome to the English We speak, with me, Feifei, and me, Roy.

B 0:08 - 0:15
I’m very impressed, Roy. I saw you doing some recycling eariler! And is that a reusable bag?

C 0:16 - 0:23
Yes, I’m saving the world one bag at the time. I was reading an article about climate emergency that our world is facing.

D 0:24 - 0:43
Ahhh so, you found the article I left on your desk. I thought you find it intersting and might help you to become more of an eco-warrior like me. I’m Super Feifei, Queen of recycling and you can be my helper, Roybot.
