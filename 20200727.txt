### A 0:00 - 0:13

Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me, FeiFei, and me, Roy. We may sound a little different that’s because we are not able to record in our normal studion during Cornavirus outbreak.

### B 0:14 - 0:25

In this programme, we have an expression that is used to describe publicly critisizing someone. Roy, why are you hiding under the desk?

### C 0:26 - 0:35

Well, I’m a bit scared at the moment. Neil said you were throwing shade at me. So I don’t want to get hit. Oh I guess it was you smashed the windows throwing all that shade around.

### D 0:36 - 0:59

Roy, I’m not throwing anything physically. I was throwing shade at you. That means I was publicly critisizing you. I was telling evreyone how terrible your favorite T-shirt. You always wear it but the film on it. It’s so uncool. Who likes “Gibbons by the sea”?

### E 1:00 - 1:06

I do. It’s a brilliant film. You should stop throwing shade. I love this T-shirt. It’s a classic.

### F 1:07 - 1:22

It’s not classic. It’s old! Also I did smash the window as I literally threw a bag of your terrible T-shirt out of the window. We’ll talk about it more after these examples.
