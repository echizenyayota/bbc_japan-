 A 0:00 - 0:12
Let’s look at some very distubing drone footage that’s been widely shared around the world. This is almost certainly over northen China, over XinJiang. Can you tell us what is happening here?

B 0:18 - 0:33
I can not see, you know this video this is not first time you show me. I still remeber last year you show me what is happneing in XinJiang. (Exactly) Let me tell you this. Have you been to XinJiang yourself?

C 0:34 - 0:35
No, I never have.

D 0:36 - 0:41
You know, Xinjiang is regarded as the most beautiful place in Xinjiang. There’s a Chinese saying you do not know how big Chinese.

E 0:42 - 0:45
Ambassador, that is not, that is not beautiful coverage however, is it?

F 0:46 - 0:57
You know, Xinjiang, that is exactly what I’m going to tell you. Since 1990 XinJiang has chemically changed because it has thousands of terrorist attacks. People can not …

G 0:58 - 1:06
Can I ask you why people are kneeling, blinded and shaven and being led to trains in modern China. Why what is going on there?

H 1:07 - 1:18
I do not know where you get this videotape, you know sometimes you have a transmission transfer of the prisons and prisoners, you know in any country.

I 1:19 - 1:20
But just what is happening here, ambassador?

J 1:21 - 1:23
I do not know what did you get this video clip.

K 1:24 - 1:32
These have been going around the world they’ve been authenticated by western intelligence agencies and by Austlarian experts who say these are Uighurs people.

L 1:33 - 2:06
Let me take a look at this. The so-called western intelligence keeping up make this a forced acquisition again China.They said one million more of vega has been persecuted. You know, how big, how many populations Xingjiang has? It’s just about 40 years ago it’s a four or five million. Now it’s 11 million people and people say, you know we impose we have a ethnic cleansing. The populataion has doubled in 40 years.

M 2:07 - 2:20
I’m sorry to interrupt but according to your own local government staistics, the population growth in Uhigur jurisdictions in that area has fallen by 84% between 2015 and 2018. 84%.

N 2:21 - 2:49
That’s not right. I gave you official speaker you asked me. I gave you this figure as a Chinese ambassador. This is a very affordable figure. In the past 40 years leagal population increased the population XinJiang increased to double the population. Population doubled. So there’s no so-called the restriction of population. There’s no so-called force abortion and so on.
