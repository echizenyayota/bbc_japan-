This is the BBC home service.Here is the news and this is Alebert Adele reading it.Japan’s long thereated aggression in the Far East began tonight with air attacks on United States naval bases in the Paciffic.

- What “Here is the news” means? I would like you to translate it into Japanese directly.
- Alebert says “Japan’s long thereated aggression in the Far East”. I would like you to say it in other way.
- Why doesn’t he use the word of “the” before “United States naval bases”?

### B 0:14 - 0:25

Fresh reports are coming in every minute. The latest facts of the situation are these.Messages from Tokyo say the Japan has announced a formal declaration of war against both United States and Britain.

- Why does he use “the” before Japan? I guess that the countries which have “the” before the name of the country are those with strong independence of each state or kingdom.
- Why doensn’t he use “the” before United States?
- What is the difference between Britain and “The UK”?

### C 0:26 - 0:47

Japan’s attacks on Amrerican naval bases in the Pacific were announced by President Roosvelt in a statement from the White House tonight.

The first statement said the naval base of Pearl Habor and other naval and military targets in the chief Hawaian island of Oahu had been attacked from the air.

Almost immediately after came the announcement that Manila and the Philippines had also been raidered.

- Where are the subject and the predicate in the 3rd sentence?
