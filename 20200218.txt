https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukmF1fDdcKA

### A 0:00 - 0:13

This is the BBC home service.Here is the news and this is Alebert Adele reading it.Japan’s long thereated aggression in the Far East began tonight with air attacks on United States naval bases in the Paciffic.

- What “Here is the news” means? I would like you to translate it into Japanese directly.
→ 「ここでニュースです」
- Alebert says “Japan’s long thereated aggression in the Far East”. I would like you to say it in other way. 
→ Japan's invasion in the Far East began tonight
- Why doesn’t he use the word of “the” before “United States naval bases”?
→ Japan Air Force attacks the naval base

### B 0:14 - 0:25

Fresh reports are coming in every minute. The latest facts of the situation are these.Messages from Tokyo say the Japan has announced a formal declaration of war against both United States and Britain.

- Why does he use “the” before Japan? I guess that the countries which have “the” before the name of the country are those with strong independence of each state or kingdom. 
→ 連合国の敵は日本だけでなく他の国もあり、文脈上日本であることを特定しなければならないため
- Why doensn’t he use “the” before United States?
→ 前に"both"がかかっているため
- What is the difference between Britain and “The UK”?

### C 0:26 - 0:47

Japan’s attacks on Amrerican naval bases in the Pacific were announced by President Roosvelt in a statement from the White House tonight.

The first statement said the naval base of Pearl Habor and other naval and military targets in the chief Hawaian island of Oahu had been attacked from the air.

Almost immediately after came the announcement that Manila and the Philippines had also been raidered.

- Where are the subject and the predicate in the 3rd sentence?

### D 0:48 - 1:12

A little while ago Mr.Steven early White House press secretary said that as far as was known at the moment,the attacks were still going on.
In the other words he said we do not know the Japanese have bombed and left.

Acting on his exective authority,President Roosevelt has ordered the mobilisation of the United States of Army and given instructions to both the Army and the Navy to carry out undisclosed orders prepared for the defense of the United States.

- Is the noun, such as "I" or "We", omitted between "as far as" and "known" → In this case, "as far as" is the subject and noun　phrase.

### E 1:13 - 1:29

So much for official news.Press messages and radio observers from Oahu state that the attacks on the island began early in the morning.And it seemed for the hundred or more planes took but some reports say that an oil tank was set on fire and an air field hit.

- I guess YouTube doesn't display the appropriate subtitle in the 3rd sentece.I guess he doesn't say "but" between "took" and "some".How do you hear it?
- I would like you to say "it seemed for the hundred or more planes took" in other way. I can't understand the meaning of "took".

→ It is "took(take) but" but it's not "took(take) part".

### F 1:30 - 1:58

As soon as the planes appeared overhead,American anti-aircraft guns opened fire.And Amrerican fighter aircraft also went up.A number of planes are said to have been brought down.Citizens were soon cleared from the streets by naval and military units with the aid of volunteers.

Many people went up to the hills to watch the raid.A radio obsevers says some damage has been done to Pearl Harbor and that the United States battleship Oklahoma built in 1914 has been hit and a fire started.

- I would like you to say the 3rd sentence in other way.I can't understand the meaning that "have" is used after "to" very well.

→ A number pf planes are said that they have been brought down.
