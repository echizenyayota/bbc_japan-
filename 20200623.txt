### A 0:00 - 0:12

Hello and welcome to the English.We speak with me,FeiFei,and me,Roy.We may sound a little different that’s beacuase we’re not able to record in our normal studios during coronavirus outbreak.

### B 0:13 - 0:18

Roy,why have you shaved off your beard?I don’t think I’ve seen your chin before.

### C 0:19 - 0:38

Well,I got your message.You told me to trim my beard.You said “It’s sad, but necessary to keep my fur low during coronavirus”.I thought it was a bit weird as my beard is made of hair, not fur.I’m not a dog,FeiFei.

### D 0:39 - 1:04

That’s debatable.I saw you run after a ball Neil threw for you.Anyway, I wasn’t talking about your beard.I said it’s very sad at the moment that some works have been furloughed, but it’s necessary for some business to do it. To furlough someone is when workers are put on a leave of absence for example, due to an economic problem the business is going through.

### E 1:05 - 1:23

Ahhh yeah!That actually makes more sense.I was so cofused about why you are talking about my beard. I agree it’s really sad some people have been furloughed.That’s our word for this programme,isn’t it?

### F 1:24 - 1:35

It is,and is not a new word, but it’s certainly more commonly used recently due to the coronavirus crisis. We’ll talk about it more after these examples.
