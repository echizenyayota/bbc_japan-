### A 0:00 - 0:13

Hello and welcome to the English We speak with me, FeiFei and me, Roy. We may sound a little different that’s because we’re not to able to record in our normal studios during coronavirus pandemic.

### B 0:14 - 0:18

Roy, I haven’t seen you posting much on social media today?

### C 0:19 - 0:25

No.I decided not to spend my time on social media becuase I want to play some video games.

### D 0:26 - 0:27

Ahhh, JOMO!

### E 0:28 - 0:31

What on erath is JOMO?

### F 0:32 - 0:38

The joy of the missing out! You are enjoying playing video games while not posting on social media.

### G 0:39 - 0:41

I didn’t know you wanted to see my posts.

### H 0:42 - 0:48

Roy, No one wants to see all those pictures of you and your dog. Let’s hear these examples.

### I 0:50 - 1:18

Climbing a mountain and not checking my emails was pure JOMO. I didn’t go to the restraunt last night with everyone from work. I had more fun staying at home watching a film. That’s Jomo. I’m going to spend week not checking social media. I’m going to do other things like listen to music. JOMO.

### J 1:20 - 1:35

This is The English We Speak from BBC Learning English and we’re talking about the expression of JOMO which is the abbreviation of ‘joy of missing out’. It means ‘to enjoy personal time instead of doing something social or on social media’.

### K 1:36 - 1:42

So, what are your JOMOs, FeiFei? What things do you like to do instead of going out.

### L 1:43 - 1:49

Well, listening to music.Watching videos of the opera while eating a lettuce.You know, normal things.

### M 1:50 - 1:59

You eat a lettuce while watching opera. That’s very specific. I’m not sure that’s everyone’s idea of a good time.

### N 2:00 - 2:08

Eating letturce keeps me healthy and I love singing opera. It’s better than playing the video games.

### O 2:09 - 2:17

I don’t agree. But I suppose everyone has different JOMOs. If you like singing opera, will you sing some for us?

### P 2:18 - 2:20

One day, Roy.But not today.

### Q 2:21 - 2:22

OK,I’m looking forward to it.
