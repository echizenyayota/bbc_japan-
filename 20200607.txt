Hi!I’m Georgina from BBC Learning English. Do you ever wonder about the difference between “All”,“Every” and “Whole”?They all have the similar meanings but are used in different ways.

"All" means the whole amount of something, 1 hundred percent. It is often followed by accountable nouns,all pronouns.

- He ate all the sugar!

"Every" has the smilar meaning to “All”.It means each one without exception.I got to the gym every day.

### D 0:38 - 0:52

"Whole" means the complete amount of something and is followed by uncountable nouns or singular nouns.

- I ate the whole cake.
