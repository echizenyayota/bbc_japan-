### A 0:00 - 0:13

Hello and welcome to the English Speak with me, FeiFei, and me, Rob. We may sound a little different that’s because we’re not able to record in our normal studios during coronavirus pandemic.

### B 0:14 - 0:18

Now Rob, why are you wearing those funny ruber shoes today?

### C 0:19 - 0:22

It’s in preparation for today’s phrase, FeiFei.

### D 0:23 - 0:28

What? Our English expression today has nothing to do with wearing shoes.

### E 0:29 - 0:37

Ah, but these are special ruber shoes to stop me sliding down any slippery slope, that is what we’re talking about, isn’t it?

### F 0:38 - 0:45

Hmm, well sort of. But it is not really about slipping down a slope, only metaphorically.

G 0:46 - 0:52

Ah, right. So it’s something to do with easily descending downhill into something.

### H 0:53 - 1:03

Yep. We describe a situation that is getting worse and will end in disaster unless it is stopped as a slippery slope. Listen to these examples.

### I 1:05 - 1:13

Having a glass of wine with your dinner is slippery slope. You’ll end up finishing the whole bottle by the end of the evening.

### J 1:15 - 1:21

Juan was on the slippery slope to getting the sack when he started to miss the important meeting with clients.

### K 1:22 - 1:27

He’s on the slippery slope to failure if he keeps missing deadline for his assignments.
