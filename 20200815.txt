### A 0:00 - 0:06

Hello! This is 6 minutes English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. And I’m Gerogina.

### B 0:07 - 0:18

After working together at the BBC Learning English many years, Georigina You and I have a GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP, don’t we?

### C 0:19 - 0:21

Sure, I think we make a great team.

### D 0:22 - 0:24

But have you ever had a boss who you just couldn’t work with?

### E 0:25 - 0:34

Oh, you mean a bad boss! Someone you just can’t get on with no matter how hard you try. Yes, I had one or two over the years. Not you. Of course, Neil.

### F 0:35 - 0:48

I’m glad to hear it, Georgina! Often this happens because workers feel they aren’t listened to by managers. Or it might be because most companies are hierachies, systems of organizing people according to their level of impotance.

### G 0:49 - 0:51

Managers on top, workers down below.

### H 0:52 - 1:00

But in this programme, we hear from companies who’ve got rid of managers and say it’s helped them to do a better job, made them happier and save money.

### I 1:01 - 1:09

We’ll meet self-management company which isn’t hierarchical and has no boss, and of course we’ll be learning some new vocabulary along the way.

### J 1:10 - 1:30

But first today’s quiz question. One of the biggest problems in hierachies is the excess cost of management and bureaucracy. But how much is that estimated to cost the US economy every year? Is it a) 3 million dolloar, b) 3 billion dollars or c)3 trillion dolloars?

### K 1:31 - 1:37

I’ll say c) 3 trillion dollars. That’s one follow by 12 zeros, a lot of money.

### L 1:38 - 1:57

Ok Georgina, we’ll find out later if you’re right? Now one of the first companies experiment successfully with self-management was Carifolnian tomato grower Morning Star. Here’s one of the employees, Doug Kirkpatricl, talking to Dina Newman for the BBC Worlda Service programme, Pople fixing the world.

### M 1:58 - 2:20

The first principle was the human beings should not use force or coertion against other human beings. And second principle was the people should keep the commitment to make each other and so we adopted them as pretty much the entire governance of the enterprise.

### N 2:21 - 2:31

Because Mornig Stars has no bosses, decisions are made by employees equally without coercion, the use of force to persuade someone to do something they do not want to do.

### O 2:32 - 2:40

As self-manager employees can’t tell other employees what to do. Everything is based on requesting someone to act and them responding.

### P 2:41 - 2:48

This motivates and empowered workers but also means they must keep their commitments, promises or firm decisions to do something when requested.
