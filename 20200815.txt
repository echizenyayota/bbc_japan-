### A 0:00 - 0:06

Hello! This is 6 minutes English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. And I’m Gerogina.

### B 0:07 - 0:18

After working together at the BBC Learning English many years, Georigina You and I have a GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP, don’t we?

### C 0:19 - 0:21

Sure, I think we make a great team.

### D 0:22 - 0:24

But have you ever had a boss who you just couldn’t work with?

### E 0:25 - 0:34

Oh, you mean a bad boss! Someone you just can’t get on with no matter how hard you try. Yes, I had one or two over the years. Not you. Of course, Neil.

### F 0:35 - 0:48

I’m glad to hear it, Georgina! Often this happens because workers feel they aren’t listened to by managers. Or it might be because most companies are hierachies, systems of organizing people according to their level of impotance.

### G 0:49 - 0:51

Managers on top, workers down below.

### H 0:52 - 1:00

But in this programme, we hear from companies who’ve got rid of managers and say it’s helped them to do a better job, made them happier and save money.

### I 1:01 - 1:09

We’ll meet self-management company which isn’t hierarchical and has no boss, and of course we’ll be learning some new vocabulary along the way.

### J 1:10 - 1:30

But first today’s quiz question. One of the biggest problems in hierachies is the excess cost of management and bureaucracy. But how much is that estimated to cost the US economy every year? Is it a) 3 million dolloar, b) 3 billion dollars or c)3 trillion dolloars?

### K 1:31 - 1:37

I’ll say c) 3 trillion dollars. That’s one follow by 12 zeros, a lot of money.

### L 1:38 - 1:57

Ok Georgina, we’ll find out later if you’re right? Now one of the first companies experiment successfully with self-management was Carifolnian tomato grower Morning Star. Here’s one of the employees, Doug Kirkpatricl, talking to Dina Newman for the BBC Worlda Service programme, Pople fixing the world.

### M 1:58 - 2:20

The first principle was the human beings should not use force or coertion against other human beings. And second principle was the people should keep the commitment to make each other and so we adopted them as pretty much the entire governance of the enterprise.

### N 2:21 - 2:31

Because Mornig Stars has no bosses, decisions are made by employees equally without coercion, the use of force to persuade someone to do something they do not want to do.

### O 2:32 - 2:40

As self-manager employees can’t tell other employees what to do. Everything is based on requesting someone to act and them responding.

### P 2:41 - 2:48

This motivates and empowered workers but also means they must keep their commitments, promises or firm decisions to do something when requested.

### Q 2:50 - 2:56

This way working is great for some, they feel listened to and have a voice in how the company is run.

### R 2:56 - 3:00

But Dina questions whether this is true for everybody working at Morning Star.

### S 3:01 - 3:11

Would it be true to say that a self-managed company like yours empowers people whole are already good and it leaves behind those who are not so good?

T 3:12 - 3:39
I’m not sure I accept the phrase “left behind”. There are some people who take full adavantage of this enviroment; others take less advantage but they do benefit becuase their voice is respected when they do propose something it must be listned to. They’re not subject to force and coertion and if they don’t act according to the comittments they can’t be held accountable by anyone.

U 3:40 - 3:55
Having no bosses sounds great but the extra responsibility can create more work and stress. Different workers respond to this different ways.And some employees may be left behind, remain at lower level than others because they are not as quick to develop.

V 3:56 - 4:05
However, other workers enjoy managing themselves and take full advantage of the system, make good use of the oppotunities to improve and achives their goal.

W 4:06 - 4:16
No matter whether employees are good self-manager or not, ultimately they are held accountable for their performance, asked to accept responsibility for the consequences of the actions.

X 4:17 - 4:23
So, although having no boss sounds good, if things go wrong, there’re no one to blame yourself.

Y 4:24 - 4:29
So, maybe we do need the managers after all, which reminds me of our quiz question.

Z 4:30 - 4:37
You asked me to estimate how much the US economy loses in excess bureaucarcy and managerial costs every year.

AA 4:38 - 4:39
And you said?

AB 4:40 - 4:41
c) 3 trillion dolloars.

AC 4:42 - 4:43
Which was absolutely right! Well done!

AD 4:44 - 4:51
And the cost keep rising because, of course, the more managers there are the more managers you need to manage the manegers.

AE 4:52 - 5:03
Today, we’ve been looking at the world of self-management, comapanies run without bosses, whick unlike most businesses, are not based on a hierachy, system of organizing people according to the level of the importance.

AF 5:04 - 5:15
Instead companies like San Francisco’s Morning Star allow employees to make their own commitments, promeises to act rather than using coercion or forceful persuasion to get results.
