Hello and welcome to the English.We speak with me,FeiFei and me,Roy.We may sound a little different that’s because we are not able to record in our normal studios during the Coronavirus outbreak.

### B 0:13 - 0:24

Roy,I saw the photo you sent the text group this morning.I didn’t know you had a fancy sports car, a mansion and swimming pool.Roy, you need to stop flexing!

### C 0:25 - 0:30

What do you mean,‘flexing’?I’m not exercising my muscles at all,right now.

### D 0:31 - 0:39

Not flexing your muscles, Roy.You’re showing off!This is our word for this program,“flexing” which means to show off.

### E 0:40 - 0:49

I’m not showing off.I just want everyone to be aware of amazing lifestyle.I’m thinking about getting some dolphins to go in my pool.

### F 0:50 - 1:02
