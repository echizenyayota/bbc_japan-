### A 0:00 - 0:06

Hello everyone! Welcome to the English We speak with me FeiFei, and it’s me, Rob.

### B 0:07 - 0:10

So Rob, I see you’re working from home again today?

### C 0:11 - 0:15

Well there’s not much choice and the current circumstances.

### D 0:16 - 0:22

That’s true, but what do you prefer? Do you like working at home or working in the office.

### E 0:23 - 0:34

Hmmm, that’s too difficult question to answer. I mean, I like being the office. I get to see everyone, it’s very sociable and we get to work together, Feifei.

### F 0:35 - 0:43

Yes, but you surely enjoy working at home too. It’s quiet and you don’t get those annoying interruptions.

### G 0:44 - 0:50

Errr, that’s true, and I can eat as many biscuits as I like without people complaining.

### H 0:51 - 0:55

Well, I think blending working is the way forward for you.

### I 0:56 - 0:58

Ooh, ‘blending working’! What’s that?

### J 0:59 - 1:10

’Blending working’ is a new expression that describes a mix of working at home and working in the office. It’s another way describing flexible working. Let’s hear some examples.
