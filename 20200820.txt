### A 0:00 - 0:06

Hello! This is the English We Speak with me FeiFei, and me, Roy.

### B 0:07 - 0:09

Roy,what are you holding?

### C 0:10 - 0:13

This? It’s a sword!

### D 0:14 - 0:18

I can’t see it’s a sword. Why do you have one?

### E 0:19 - 0:30

Well, I overheard your friend Sandra is living in a bubble. So I asked my pal at the museum if I could borrow a sword to help your friend escape.

### F 0:31 - 0:47

No, Roy. I said “Sanddra lives in bubble”. But it means that she doesn’t really accept new ideas and all her firends have this same way of thinking. Living in a bubble is the expression we looking at in this programme.

### G 0:48 - 0:56

Ah, that makes more sense. I just imagined she might have got stuck in a bubble after washing hands.

### H 0:57 - 1:03

Roy, your imagination never ceases to amaze me. You know what should I do?

### I 1:04 - 1:07

I think we should listen to some examples.

### J 1:09 - 1:14

Bob and his friends think that climate change isn’t real. They live in bubble.

### K 1:15 - 1:19

Nelson lives in bubble. He never tries the new foods and goes out with new people.

### L 1:20 - 1:24

Geraldine doesn’t want to meet my new friends. She thinks they live in bubble.

### M 1:25 - 1:44

This is the English We Speak from BBC Learning English and we’re talking about the expression, “living in a bubble” which is described someone who doesn’t listen to people with different ideas, or maybe is a little sheltered from society.

### N 1:45 - 1:51

I think it’s sad. When you live in bubble, because they don’t get to experience new idea or have their mind change.

### O 1:52 - 2:03

Ah, I don’t live in bubble. It’s why I like working with you because you have very different ideas to me and I like listening to them. You’re always wrong but I still like you.

### P 2:04 - 2:08

Oh! Thanks FeiFei. I guess I shoud take the sword back to the museum.

### Q 2:09 - 2:11

You should! Bye, Roy.
