### E 0:53 - 1:35(Interview)

I’m from the UK.I’ve been living here in Stockholm,Sweden for last five years.Recently we’ve seen a rise number of British tourists coming here to the barbershop as a sort of little mini break from the UK to come to Sweden and get a haircut.Of course, we have to treat our customers. We’re due respect and a friendliness and welcoming them.

But at the back of your mind you know that they’re flouting regulations and rules by coming in and getting a haircut. It makes me feel pretty awkward to know that people are traveling and taking advantage of the relative freedom we have here in Sweden when I’m not able to travel back to the UK and see my friends and family myself.
