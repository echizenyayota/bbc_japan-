Hello! This is 6 minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.

And I’m Sam. What’s the matter, Neil? You sound upset.

C 0:15 - 0:23
Well, I am, Sam. I just spent an hour working on my computer when it suddely froze. I lost everything and had to start all over again.

Modern computers and internet have revolutinaized the way we lived today bringing us to world with a click of a button. But not everyone feels happy about these technological developments.

While potentially acting as a force for good and progress, the internet also provides a way of spreading hate and misinformation. And for some people, the world wide web remains mysterious and confusing place.

In this programme, we’ll hear about new academic subject called Web Science. Web Sciece studies the technolgy behind the internet.

But from the human side, it’s also interested in how people interact with each other online. So we’ll be asking whether studying Web Science could make the internet better for humanity in the future.

I 1:16 - 1:31
But first it’s time for our quiz question. I wonder what the pioneers of the internet think about how it is used today. So the question is, who invented the World Wide Web? Was it a) Bill Gates, b) Tim Berners-Lee, or c) Steve Jobs?
