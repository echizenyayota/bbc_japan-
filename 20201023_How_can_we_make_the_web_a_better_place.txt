A 0:06 - 0:11
Hello! This is 6 minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.

B 0:12 - 0:14
And I’m Sam. What’s the matter, Neil? You sound upset.

C 0:15 - 0:23
Well, I am, Sam. I just spent an hour working on my computer when it suddely froze. I lost everything and had to start all over again.

D 0:24 - 0:29
Agghh, that’s so frustrating like pop up internet ads and buffering videos that never play.

E 0:30 - 0:40
Modern computers and internet have revolutinaized the way we lived today bringing us to world with a click of a button. But not everyone feels happy about these technological developments.

F 0:41 - 0:54
While potentially acting as a force for good and progress, the internet also provides a way of spreading hate and misinformation. And for some people, the world wide web remains mysterious and confusing place.

G 0:55 - 1:03
In this programme, we’ll hear about new academic subject called Web Science. Web Sciece studies the technolgy behind the internet.

H 1:04 - 1:15
But from the human side, it’s also interested in how people interact with each other online. So we’ll be asking whether studying Web Science could make the internet better for humanity in the future.

I 1:16 - 1:31
But first it’s time for our quiz question. I wonder what the pioneers of the internet think about how it is used today. So the question is, who invented the World Wide Web? Was it a) Bill Gates, b) Tim Berners-Lee, or c) Steve Jobs?

J 1:32 - 1:39
Well, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were the brains behind Microsoft and Apple Mac, so I’m going to say c) Tim Berners-Lee!

K 1:40 - 1:49
OK,Sam, we’ll find out later. Now because of coronavirus the annual Web Science Conference was held online this year. Its theme was “making web human-centric”.

L 1:50 - 2:01
One of the conference’s key speakers and co-founder of the new discipline of the Web Science, was Dame Wendy Hall. Here she is speaking to BBC World Services, Digital Planet.

M 2:02 - 2:26
People think about the web as a technology but actually it’s co-created by society. We put the content on, we interact with the technology, with the plattforms, with the social media networks to create it.

What we study is how that works as an ecosystem, this coming together of people and technology, and it’s very interdisciplinary, very sotio-technichal and of course these day a lot of it is powered by AI.

N 2:27 - 2:46
Web Science is not only interested in technology side of the internet. As a subject it’s very interdisciplinary - involoving two more academic subjects or areas of knowledge. Web Science combines degital technology with subjects ranging from psychology and robotics to economics and sociology.

O 2:47 - 3:00
Exchaneges between humans and the computer can be seen in social media networks, websites, apps and computer programme, like Facebook and Instagram, which allow people to use electronic devices to communicate and share information.

P 3:01 - 3:10
This view of technology sees internet as an ecosystem - a complex partner relationships and mutual influences that exists between all living things and their enviroment.

Q 3:11 - 3:18
One ongoing and topical example of websites helpfully interacting with humans is the Covid tracing app.

R 3:19 - 3:29
You might think the mobile phone app, which tracks movements and contact between people to combat coronavirus, would be useful practical application of intenet technology.

S 3:30 - 3:39
But as Carly Kind, Director the Ada Lovelance Institute in Cambridge, explained to BBC World Services’s Degital Planet, things are never that straightforward.

T 3:40 - 4:04
Actually, there’re a lot of more fundamental questions that haven’t been answered yet such as : is Bluetooth even as equipment adequate mechanism for doing what it says on the tin, which is detecting contact between two people?

The trial so far show that it is not actually that great and so, do we know for sure that these apps work and they work in the ways we want them to?Do we get the public health information that we need?

U 4:05 - 4:12
Apps like this designed to support public health - services to improve standard of health of a coutry’s general population.

V 4:13 - 4:28
But Curly thinks the mechanisms used must be suitable and adequate - they must actually work or do what it says on the tin - an informal idiom meaning work exactly as it is intended to.

W 4:29 - 4:35
To find this out trials - tests to discover how effective or suitable something is - are carried out over a period of time.

X 4:36 - 4:41
The kind of trials which were carried out during the invention of the internet in the first place, right, Neil?

Y 4:42 - 4:53
Ah, yes. The invention of the internet - or to be more accurate World Wide Web.
In our quiz question, I asked you who invented the World Wide Web, What did you say, Sam?

Z 4:53 - 4:56
I said b) Tim Beners-Lee.

AA 4:57 - 5:02
Well, you’re first class Web Scientist, Sam because that’s the correct answer.

AB 5:03 - 5:20
Great! In this programme, we’ve been hearing about Web Science, a new interdisciplinary subject, combaining several areas of study, which investigates the ecosystem of the internet - the complex pattern of interconnections between humans and enviroment.

AC 5:21 - 5:32
Social media networks, website and apps, like Facebook - which let people use the electronics devices to communicate on the internet - show how humans and technology can successfully interact.

AD 5:33 - 5:45
A new Covid contact tracing app is currently undergoing trials - tests to see if it works effectively. This will discover if it does what it says on the tin - works as it’s supposed to.

AE 5:46 - 5:56
If successful, by alerting people to coronavirus risks, the apps will support public health - services aimed at improving the health of the general population.

AF 5:57 - 5:58
And thas’s all from us for now.

AG 5:59 - 6:05
And we hope you’ll join us again soon for more topical English vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now!(Bye bye!)
