A
China has accused Indian troops of illegally crossing a disputed Himalayan border and firing “provocative” warning shots at patrolling soldiers. China’s military said its soldiers were “forced to take countermeasures”, though it is not clear what they were. India rejected the allegations and accused Chinese troops of firing in the air during the face-off in the high-altitude Ladakh region.

Relations between the countries have steadily deteriorated in recent months. India said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had tried to approach a forward Indian position and “fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate own troops”. “At no stage has the Indian army transgressed across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) or resorted to use of any agressive means, including firing,” the statement from India’s military said.

C
The allegations of firing, if true, would be the first time in 45 years that shots were fired there. A 1996 agreement between both countries bars the use of guns and explosives from the Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border is known, although soldiers have clashed there before.

D
According to Chinese state media outlet the Global Times, the Indian troops had “illegally crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) into the Shenpao mountain region near the south bank of Pangong Tso Lake”, quoting senior colonel Zhang Shuili, a spokesperson of the PLA.

E
India’s move “seriously violated related agreements reached by both sides, stirred up tensions in the region… and is very vile in nature”, said Mr Zhang. But India’s statement added that the army was “committed to maintaining peace”, adding that it was also “determined to protect national integrity and sovereignty at all costs”.
