Hello and welcome to the English.We speak with me,FeiFei ,and me,Roy.We may sound a little different.That's because we're not able to record in our normal studios during the Coronavirus outbreak. In this program we have an expression that means you enjoy something more than anything else you do.

FeiFei: Roy, you love video games, don't you? 
Roy: Yes, I do love them.I play them all the time.
FeiFei: I know!You live for video games.
Roy: No, I'm an English teacher.Teaching English is my job.I don't play video games for living.
FeiFei: Roy,I said the live for video games, which means you enjoy them more than anything else.Some people live for art ,or they live for sports.
Roy: Ahh,got you.I undestand.And what do you live for FeiFei?
FeiFei: I live for music.That'why I always listen to my MP3 player when you're speaking.Now let's have a look at these examples.
