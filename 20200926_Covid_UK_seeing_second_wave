A
The UK is “now seeing a second wave” of Covid-19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, adding: “It’s been inevitable we’d see it in this country.” Mr Johnson said he did not “want to go into bigger lockdown measures” but that tighter social distancing rules might be necessary.

B
It is understood a new three-tiered set of restrictions is being considered. The plan would aim to avoid a national lockdown but could stop household-to-household contact.

C
The first tier would be the level of measures currently in place in most parts of England now - with social distancing the key aspect. The second tier would involve what is currently being imposed in north-east of England - curfews on hospitality venues and a ban on meetings between households. The final third tier would involve stricter lockdown measures.
