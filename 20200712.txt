"disrupted", prevented from continuing.

Yes, “disrupted”, “d, i, s, r, u, p, t, e, d”, disrupted, there’re three syllabeles in this word. The stress is on the “rupt”, the middle syllabel. Neil, Would you like to demonstrate?

### P 2:15 - 2:35

Very good. Thank you. So this word starts with lovely prefix the letters “d, i, s”, “dis” I’ve found in front of a lot of words and general meaning of the prefix. “dis” is the often bad or wrong. So we already know that there’s something it’s describing something difficult.
