### A 0:00 - 0:36

This is London.He's Majesty King Jeorge the sixth.Let us remember the men in all services and the women and all of the services who have laid down their lives.We have come to the end about the tribulation.And they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing.

### B 0:37 - 0:57

I speak to you today at the same hour as my father did, exactly 75 years ago. His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad who had sacrificed so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a “great deliverance”.

### C 0:58 - 1:05

The war had been the total war. It had affected everyone.And no one was immune from its impact.Whether it be the men and women called up to serve, families serparated each other,or people asked to take up new rolls and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play.
